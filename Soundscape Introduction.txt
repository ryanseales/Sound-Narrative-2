My vision with this soundscape was to take the listeners on a journey through the process of sleep. I wanted to immerse the listeners in an atmosphere that represents falling asleep, entering a dream, and then waking up. The goal was to accomplish this by incorporating both ambient sounds and music that I recorded.
