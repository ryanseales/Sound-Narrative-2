Since my last export, I have changed the majority of the music element of my soundscape. I used two synths to play some chords and a simple melody and I added multiple harp samples with a heavy delay effect on them. During the part that is supposed to represent the dream, I added various atmospheric field recording sounds to give it a sense of an environment. It transitions from a public sounding environment with multiple people speaking in Portuguese to rain noises. After the rain stops, I added some bird and forest noises. Towards the end of the dream, I used the sound of a train passing by and ocean waves. The soundscape ends to the sound of an alarm clock in the morning. 
The intro of the soundscape is a snoring sound and I automated reverb and delay to give it an effect of transitioning into a dream. I still want to add maybe one more sound of someone getting ready for bed before the snoring sound, but other than that the soundscape is pretty complete.
