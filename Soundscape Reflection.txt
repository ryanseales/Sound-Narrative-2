For this soundscape, I envisioned that I would use a combination of atmospheric ambient noises with music that I recorded and that they would seamlessly transition through the cycles of sleep (falling asleep, entering a dream, and waking up). To accomplish this I first started working on the musical portion which would represent the dream stage of the sleep cycle. The first recording I made I ended up changing, but I settled on using a simple chord progression and melody with synths. I added a delay effect to give a dreamy vibe. Along with this, I added various harp samples with heavy reverb and delay. These added to the dreamy effect as well as added some stereo width the mix. I put an auto panning effect only on the delay and reverb, so the main harp sound would be center panned, but the effects would alternate left to right. After I had the musical portion done, I focused on adding the more atmospheric field recording sounds. It starts out with some deep breathing and snoring sounds. I then use automated delay effects to give the effect of falling asleep. This then transitions into the musical part where I ended up adding a variety of field recording sounds like rain, people speaking, etc over the music. The music slowly fades and ends with the sound of an alarm clock in the morning and a person waking up. This represents the end of the dream and the end of the sleep cycle.


I added some screenshots of the virtual instrument I was using to record the synths and then a screenshot of the mix bus. The mix bus is where I added most of the effects.
